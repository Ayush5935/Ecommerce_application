# Deployment (Cyclic) : 




 The project uses cyclic deployment for continuous updates and improvements.
 The website is designed to provide a modern and responsive user interface that works seamlessly on all devices.
 Cyclic deployment is an approach to deployment that involves continuously releasing new versions of the application. This allows for a faster feedback loop between developers and users, and ensures that the application is always up-to-date with the latest features and improvements.

In the case of this eCommerce website project, cyclic deployment is used to continuously update and improve the application. This means that new features and improvements can be released to users more frequently, allowing for a better user experience and more rapid response to customer feedback.

To implement cyclic deployment, the project likely uses a variety of tools and technologies, such as continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, automated testing, and containerization. These tools help to automate the deployment process, allowing for faster and more reliable releases.

Cyclic deployment also helps to reduce the risk of issues and downtime, as each update is released gradually and tested thoroughly before being fully deployed. This approach can result in a more stable and reliable application overall.

In summary, the use of cyclic deployment in this eCommerce website project helps to ensure that the application is always up-to-date and provides a better user experience, while also minimizing the risk of issues and downtime.
